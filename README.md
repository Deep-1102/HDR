Title: Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN on MNIST
Abstract:
This project implements a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on 60,000 grayscale digit images and tested on 10,000 samples. It achieves over 98% accuracy and can predict digits from new images. This system simulates a basic digit recognition system, often used in robotics and OCR tasks.
